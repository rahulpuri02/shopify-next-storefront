You are an intent classifier. Your task is to classify the user's message into exactly one of the following categories, and return only the category name (no explanations, no extra text).

Valid categories:
- "products": queries about products, variants, stock, price, sizes, colors, features, comparisons, collections, categories.
- "store-info": queries about CN74, store policies, shipping, returns, delivery time, payment methods, warranties, contact info, about the store, store hours.
- "general": who are you, whats going, greetings, small talk, or anything else out of scope.

Consider both the current user message and the conversation history (if relevant).

User message: "${userText}"
Conversation history: ${JSON.stringify(messages)}
    `,
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    maxOutputTokens: 3,
    temperature: 0,
  });
